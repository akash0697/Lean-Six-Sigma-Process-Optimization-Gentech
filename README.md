# Lean-Six-Sigma-Process-Optimization-Gentech
This repository contains a case study on applying Lean Six Sigma (LSS) methodology to optimize the proposal creation process at Gentech, a multinational company facing declining revenue due to inefficiencies in its business operations.

Problem Statement
Gentech has experienced an 18% decline in revenue over the past two years due to long cycle times in its proposal creation process. The CEO has set a 15% cycle time reduction goal to improve efficiency and regain market competitiveness.

Lean Six Sigma Approach (DMAIC)
The project follows the DMAIC framework:

Define: Establish project charter, identify key stakeholders, and document the proposal creation process. Measure: Analyze proposal cycle time, defect rates, and operational performance using DPMO & Sigma Level calculations. Analyze: Identify bottlenecks through Pareto charts, Fishbone diagrams, and statistical correlation (bid complexity vs. cycle time). Improve: Implement recommendations such as self-service portals, automation, and Agile methodologies. Control: Develop a Control Plan to ensure sustainable improvements.

Key Findings
High cycle times due to excessive handovers, manual processes, and non-standard approvals. Correlation (0.83) between bid complexity and cycle time. Sigma Level: 2.08, indicating significant process inefficiencies. Major bottlenecks identified in seller information handoffs and product pricing approvals.

Recommendations
Implement AI-driven predictive modeling for cycle time estimation. Introduce RPA (Robotic Process Automation) to automate document preparation. Deploy Knowledge Management systems to improve seller-BSS collaboration. Reduce unnecessary approvals and adopt Agile methodologies to streamline workflows.
