# **Project Overview**


This repository contains a case study on applying Lean Six Sigma (LSS) methodology to optimize the proposal creation process at Gentech, a multinational company facing declining revenue due to inefficiencies in its business operations.

# **Contents**


Lean Six Sigma Gentech.docx – A detailed case study report outlining the problem, process, and potential solutions.
Lean Six Sigma - Case Study - Gentech.pptx – A presentation summarizing the case study with key findings, data analysis, and recommendations.

# **Problem Statement**


Gentech has experienced an 18% decline in revenue over the past two years due to long cycle times in its proposal creation process. The CEO has set a 15% cycle time reduction goal to improve efficiency and regain market competitiveness.

# **Lean Six Sigma Approach (DMAIC)**


The project follows the DMAIC framework:

Define: Establish project charter, identify key stakeholders, and document the proposal creation process.
Measure: Analyze proposal cycle time, defect rates, and operational performance using DPMO & Sigma Level calculations.
Analyze: Identify bottlenecks through Pareto charts, Fishbone diagrams, and statistical correlation (bid complexity vs. cycle time).
Improve: Implement recommendations such as self-service portals, automation, and Agile methodologies.
Control: Develop a Control Plan to ensure sustainable improvements.

# **Key Findings**


High cycle times due to excessive handovers, manual processes, and non-standard approvals.
Correlation (0.83) between bid complexity and cycle time.
Sigma Level: 2.08, indicating significant process inefficiencies.
Major bottlenecks identified in seller information handoffs and product pricing approvals.

# **Recommendations**


Implement AI-driven predictive modeling for cycle time estimation.
Introduce RPA (Robotic Process Automation) to automate document preparation.
Deploy Knowledge Management systems to improve seller-BSS collaboration.
Reduce unnecessary approvals and adopt Agile methodologies to streamline workflows.
